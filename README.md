<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The MyoCoach is a device intended for people with upper limb amputees wishing to wear a myoelectric prosthesis made up of 2 EMG electrodes.

It allows you to exercise the contraction of the muscles of the forearm thanks to a video game inspired by Flappy Bird, and to train in the control of the future prosthesis.

The MyoCoach can also be addressed to health professionals and more particularly to orthopedic and occupational therapists, because it allows to correctly place the myoelectric sensors and to adjust them for an optimal use of myoelectric prostheses.

The MyoCoach allows you to:

<ul>
        <li> Measure muscle potential using myoelectric sensors</li>
        <li> Define the optimal position of the sensors</li>
        <li> Adjust the sensors using the potentiometers </li>
        <li> Practice muscle contraction and coordination</li>
  <li> Very ergonomic and flexible display of emg signals </li>
  <li> Serious game  to familiarize  without annoying with EMGs </li>
        
 </ul>


### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [HTML](https://html.com/)
* [CSS](https://css-tricks.com/)
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The idea is to use the screen of a smartphone to display the application. The system is intended to be very flexible, easy to use inexpensive and portable. A small portable box for example will contain all the device.

### User Manual

We give more details about how to get the best experiences with the **Myo Coach** in the [user manual](https://github.com/Yven92/MyoCoachV2/blob/codes/docs/user-manual.md).

### Prerequisites

* [Raspberry pi ](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
* [2 EMG sensor]
* [USB cable]

### Installation

You can design the MyoCoach for less than **70â‚¬**. More details in the [COSTS](COSTS.md) file.

Follow this steps to make your own **Myo Coach**

**:one: Download the src**

Dowload the [latest release](https://github.com/orthopus/0102-myocoach-diy/releases/latest)

or clone the **0102-myocoach-diy** repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/orthopus/0102-myocoach-diy.git
```

**:two: Make the box**

Follow the [manufacturing manual](./docs/manufacturing-manual.md)

**:three: Flash the Arduino Board**
